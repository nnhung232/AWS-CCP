# AWS Cloud Concepts
## 6 Advantages of Cloud
- Trade capital expense for variable expense: Instead of having to invest in data centers & servers before you know how you're going to use them, you can only pay when you consume computing resources, and pay only for how much you consume.
- Benefit from massive economies of scale: by using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customer is aggregated in the cloud, providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which translates into lower pay as-you-go price.
- Stop guessing about capacity.
- Increase speed and agility.
- Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
- Go global in minutes
## Cloud computing models
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Các service infrastructure cơ bản (basic building blocks for cloud IT). VD như: ta lauch và manage 1  cloud linux server, đó là IaaS. IaaS provide highest level of flexibility and management control over IT resources. Các IaaS:  Virtual private cloud (VPC), Elastic cloud compute (EC2), Elastic block store (EBS).
- Platform as a Service (PaaS):
